With Google Play App Signing, you can securely manage your app signing keys for new or existing apps. Keys are stored on the same secure infrastructure Google uses to store its own keys.

If you lose your keystore or think it may be compromised, Google Play App Signing makes it possible to request a reset to your upload key. If you're not enrolled in Google Play App Signing and lose your keystore, you'll need to publish a new app with a new package name.

Signing up for this program entitles you to some benefits. 

### App Optimisation.
On your request, goolge provides optimisation services. How is this possible :

1. You provide an upload key signed APK to Google Play
2. There's a window to apply for optimizations before re-signing with the app signing key for delivery
3. Applying enrolls your apk for an optimisation.
